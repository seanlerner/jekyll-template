# Sean's Jekyll Template Site

Just a template for Sean to use.

You can use it too if you want.

It includes defaults that I like:

## layouts
  - markdown
  - html

## includes
  - head
  - foot
  - nav

## sass
  - sass syntax
  - variable support

## etc
  - javascript
  - terseness
  - great colour scheme


# TODOs

If you use this template, you may want to start by:

- modifying the title in config.yml
